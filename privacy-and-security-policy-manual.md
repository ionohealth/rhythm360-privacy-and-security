## Workforce Security Responsibilities

## Office Location Security Policies

The first line of Physical Safeguards at the Office Location against wrongful PHI access is the individual RhythmScience Employee or Associate. RhythmScience Employees and Associates are responsible for the security of all data that may come to them, in whatever format. RhythmScience is responsible for maintaining ongoing training programs to inform RhythmScience Employees and Associates of these security requirements, in accordance with Section 17 of this Manual.

Challenge Unrecognized Personnel:It is the responsibility of all RhythmScience Employees and Associates to take positive actions to provide physical security in the Office Location. If you see an unrecognized person in the Office Location, you should challenge them as to their right to be there. Any challenged person who does not respond appropriately should be immediately reported to the Privacy Officer or the Security Officer. Visitors to areas containing sensitive data shall be escorted by appropriate staff members.

Hard Copy Reports or Work Papers:Never leave paper records that may contain PHI around your work area.

Protect Data in Your Possession: View or access only the information that you have a need to see to complete your work assignment. You should regularly review the data you have stored to ensure no PHI is accidentally stored on your computer.

## Authorization Process for PHI Access

RhythmScience follows the &quot;need to know&quot; principle when providing individual workforce members access to PHI or other sensitive / confidential information. That means that individuals should only have access to the PHI necessary for them to perform their job function. This access should also be limited in time based on the project or work function of the individual. PHI access by Subcontractors follows the same principle and is limited as described in Section 4.

Authorized Computers must be approved by the Privacy Officer before they can access or store PHI. The utmost care should be taken to ensure that Authorized Computers are not stolen and that PHI is not compromised.

## Prohibited Activities

RhythmScience Employees and Associates are prohibited from the following activities. The list is not exhaustive. Other prohibited activities may be referenced elsewhere in this document or otherwise implemented by the Security Officer.

- Crashing an information system. Deliberately crashing an information system is strictly prohibited. RhythmScience Employees and Associates may not realize that they caused a system crash, but if it is shown that the crash occurred as a result of an RhythmScience Employee or Associate action, a repetition of the action by that user may be viewed as a deliberate act.
- Attempting to break into an information resource or to bypass a security feature. This includes running password-cracking programs or sniffer programs, and attempting to circumvent file or other resource permissions.
- Introducing, or attempting to introduce, computer viruses, Trojan horses, peer-to-peer (&quot;P2P&quot;) or other malicious code into an information system.
- Exception: RhythmScience Employees or Associates authorized by the Security Officer may test the resiliency of a system. Such personnel may test for susceptibility to hardware or software failure, security against hacker attacks, and system infection.
- Browsing. The purposeful attempt to view or access confidential or sensitive information to which you have not been granted access by the appropriate approval procedure is strictly prohibited.
- Unauthorized Software. Use of unauthorized software is prohibited. All software installed on Authorized Computers that accesses PHI must be approved by the Security Officer.
- Software Use. Violating or attempting to violate the terms of use or license agreement of any software product used by RhythmScience is strictly prohibited.

## Workforce Member Oversight Policies

RhythmScience reserves the right, at its discretion, to audit any RhythmScience Employee or Associate&#39;s files or electronic communications to the extent necessary to ensure all work-related activities are conducted in compliance with the Security Rule. Workforce member should expect such auditing to occur, at minimum, on an annual basis or more frequently in response to Security Incidents and environmental or operational changes impacting the security of PHI, e.g., PHI breaches, addition of new hardware or software, and increased threats.

RhythmScience Employees and Associates should structure all work communications with recognition of the fact that such content may be audited, and that any electronic communication could be forwarded, intercepted, printed or stored by others.

## Reporting Software Malfunctions

RhythmScience Employees and Associates should inform the appropriate RhythmScience personnel when the user&#39;s software does not appear to be functioning correctly. The malfunction - whether accidental or deliberate - may pose a HIPAA security risk. If the user, or the user&#39;s supervisor, suspects a computer virus infection, the following steps should be taken immediately:

- Stop using the computer.
- Do not carry out any commands, including commands to \&lt;Save\&gt; data.
- Do not close any of the computer&#39;s windows or programs.
- Do not turn off the computer or peripheral devices.
- If possible, physically disconnect the computer from networks to which it is attached.
- Inform the appropriate personnel as soon as possible. Write down any unusual behavior of the computer (screen messages, unexpected disk access, unusual responses to commands) and the time when they were first noticed.
- Write down any changes in hardware, software, or software use that preceded the malfunction.
- Do not attempt to remove a suspected virus.

The Security Officer should monitor the resolution of the malfunction and make recommendations on action steps to avert future similar occurrences.


## Security patch management

RhythmScience will use commercially reasonable operational practices, in accordance with relevant NIST guidelines, to identify, classify, remediate, and mitigate potential instances of Production System vulnerabilities. This may include, on a regular basis:

- Conducting vulnerability scans and penetration testing of RhythmScience Production Environment;
- Classifying security patches according to high priority / low priority framework and prioritizing high priority patches when there is an operational conflict;
- Reviewing published vulnerability threat assessments and security patch recommendations; and
- Applying system security updates and patches within 30 days of release.


## Security Incident Response Policy

RhythmScience Employees and Associates are to promptly report to the Privacy Officer all privacy and security-related events that might involve the acquisition, access, use or disclosure of PHI in a manner not permitted under HIPAA. Reports of all privacy and security-related events shall be escalated in a timely fashion. The Privacy Officer shall determine whether a privacy or security-related event constitutes a Security Incident that requires Customer reporting based on a fact-specific risk assessment and in accordance with NIST 800-61 guidelines.

The Rhythm360 platform is a Medical Device Data System that retrieves data from the OEMs of cardiac devices. The terms and conditions establish that the vendor portals are the primary source of data and provide continuity of data if the Rhythm360 platform is not available, therefore ensuring patient safety at all times. RhythmScience provides status notification regarding site availability to ensure patient safety.

Each Security Incident will be analyzed by the Privacy Officer, in conjunction with the Security Officer to determine if changes in the existing security structure are necessary. It is the responsibility of the Privacy Officer to provide training on any procedural changes that may be required in response to a Security Incident.

This Section 2.7 supplements the Breach Notification Policy contained in Section 20 of this Manual.

**Incident Response**

The Security Officer shall develop processes for responding to security violations and incidents to limit further damage to information assets and to permit identification and prosecution of violators. These processes shall be risk-based, formally documented, detailed instructions, designed to respond to known or suspected system conditions that warrant an incident response (i.e., suspected system intrusions, known breaches of security, interruptions in service, etc.). The incident response process must include the following elements:

**Incident identification and analysis**

The Security Officer shall analyze all log information from systems to establish a baseline of the events expected for normal system and network operations. Any deviations from these baseline events shall be set to alert security personnel such as system administrators and network operations. Identification should include methods for isolating the event and categorizing the event according to business criticality. The business criticality should determine the next steps and should be formally documented within the incident response plan. This should include types of events, persons to contact, and steps to validate the propriety of the security event prior to escalation.

**Incident escalation and reporting**

The Security Officer shall formally document a list of personnel to contact based on the type of event and the impact on the system (intrusion reporting &quot;calling tree&quot;) and/or an Incident Response Team. The list should include name, title, and contact numbers (e.g., emergency pagers, home numbers, etc.) to reach individuals at any hour of the day. This list should be safeguarded and updated often. The notification should specifically include who is to be notified, in what manner, and in what time-frame, according to the nature and categorization of the event. The types and frequency of follow-up procedures should be specified for each event category. Responsibility should be assigned to specific individuals or positions to establish accountability dependent on the type of incident.

**Incident response processes and procedures**

The Security Officer shall develop specific processes and procedures to contain, remove, and return the system to its original state. Elements of these processes and procedures should include a baseline &quot;hashed&quot; image of all monitored hosts to facilitate containment, removal, and recovery. The Security Officer, based on the classification of their information assets, type of platform, and architecture, must develop action plans. This plan should be formally documented and updated based on changes within the operating environment.

**Documentation and Investigation**

The Security Officer shall document key elements of the identified incident (i.e. nature, timing, estimated effect, actions taken). The level of investigation employed and who is involved (i.e., internal vs. external parties) should be related to the nature of the event and its category. The anti-virus standard &quot;Action Plan&quot; will be leveraged as the building block for components of the incident response procedures. All information associated with an intrusion should be captured and securely stored. This includes a log of all steps (automated and manual) performed during all components of the intrusion analysis.

It is very important to collect, record, and securely store all events of the intrusion analysis. This will allow for the possibility of future prosecution if necessary.

&quot; **Post mortem&quot; review procedures and lessons learned**

The Security Officer shall conduct a &quot;post mortem&quot; review of the intrusion within a week of completing the intrusion investigation. The post mortem shall analyze the effectiveness of the incident response processes and procedures. The post mortem results should be formally documented and distributed to senior management to raise awareness. Additionally, any applicable revisions to the incident response processes and operational procedures should be performed in a timely manner to prevent a reoccurrence of the incident.

**Periodic testing**

The Security Officer shall periodically review the current state of their incident response plan through periodic announced and unannounced testing.

Refer to RhythmScience Incident Response Plan for further information.


## De-identification / Re-identification of PHI

RhythmScience may de-identify PHI in its discretion for lawful commercial purposes. When removing identifiable information from PHI, RhythmScience employs practices to conform with the Safe Harbor method for the de-identification of PHI, as directed by the Privacy Rule Section 164.514(b)(2).

De-identification as used herein is defined as the removal of the 18 identifiers listed in 164.514(b)(2)(i) that could be used to identify an individual or the relatives, employers, or household members of such individual, provided that RhythmScience does not have actual knowledge that the de-identified data could be used alone or in combination with other information to identify an individual who is the subject of the information.

Re-identification policy: RhythmScience maintains a general policy that de-identified PHI shall only be re-identified using a cross-reference code or other means of record identification, which is not derived from or related to information about the individual, or otherwise capable of being translated to identify the individual. In addition, the code shall not be disclosed for any purpose nor can the mechanism for re-identification be disclosed.


## background checks

All RhythmScience Employees and Associates shall undergo an accredited background check before they are designated as Authorized Workforce Members and permitted to access PHI. Access to background check records shall be limited to the management team.  The management team shall evaluate the results to assure that there is no indication that the workforce member presents a risk for theft of confidential data. If any results are suspicious, the management team shall review the background check file with said workforce member and provide the individual with an opportunity to explain the results.  If no satisfactory explanation is provided, the management team shall make a recommendation to appropriate personnel that such Employee or Associate be prohibited from accessing PHI or in extreme cases, be terminated from employment.  RhythmScience shall retain each workforce member&#39;s background check documentation for, at minimum, a period of three (3) years following contract termination.


## Substance Abuse Policy

Unacceptable behavior by RhythmScience Employees and Associates includes being under the influence of alcohol or illegal substances or misusing or abusing prescription drugs or medicines while on RhythmScience business. RhythmScience reserves the right to take disciplinary action, up to and including immediate suspension or termination for failure to refrain from such behavior.

## Electronic Signatures

In compliance with all applicable federal electronic signature (&quot;e-signature&quot;) requirements, most activities at RhythmScience utilize e-signatures. When a signed authorization is required for a disclosure of PHI not otherwise permitted by the HIPAA Privacy Rule (e.g., marketing or research disclosures), the following conditions shall apply with respect to e-signatures:

1. The authorization must clearly demonstrate the terms, clearly demonstrate the intent of the signatory and the option should exist for the signatory to receive a printed or emailed copy of the authorization.

2. As applicable, the Privacy Officer shall implement a system to validate the identity of all transacting parties in order to avoid disputes about whether the person who entered into the agreement actually had the authority to do so.


## Clean Desk Policy

When leaving their desk, workforce members will ensure that no sensitive documents are easily visible upon their desks. Unattended computers shall be locked by the workforce member upon leaving their work area. All company laptops will have the automatic screen lock function set to automatically activate upon fifteen (15) minutes of inactivity. Workforce Members are not allowed to take any action that would override this setting.

  
## Network Security Policy

##### Purpose

RhythmScience maintains a network at its Office Location and this policy serves to describe the security controls in place.

##### Infrastructure

The Office Location network infrastructure shall be stored in a secured environment. The core networking equipment resides in a locked closet designated for the purpose of housing it and the rest of the Office Location&#39;s IT infrastructure and supplies. This room contains sufficient air conditioning for the optimal functioning of the equipment inside. Only a small number of RhythmScience personnel are given access to this room as necessary for their roles.

All networking equipment in use for the Office Location network is maintained to ensure latest security patches are implemented and service work is recorded. Default manufacturer passwords are changed prior to deployment in a live environment.

Firewalls exist between the Office Location network and the public internet. Unified threat management, malicious code detection, and other industry standard measures are active.


## Identification and Authentication


## User LogIn IDs

Individual RhythmScience Employees and Associates shall have unique login IDs for all Approved Tools and network access points. Security requirements include:

- Each user shall be assigned a unique identifier, which is keyed to specific access privileges.
- Users shall be responsible for the use and misuse of their individual login ID.

All user login IDs are audited at least twice yearly and all inactive login IDs are revoked. Upon the departure of any RhythmScience Employee or Associate, his/her login ID shall be revoked by appropriate personnel.


## Passwords

**User Account Passwords**

User account passwords are required in order for RhythmScience Employees and Associates to gain access to all Approved Tools and network access points. All passwords are restricted by a company-wide password policy to be of a &quot;Strong&quot; nature. This means that all passwords must conform to restrictions and limitations that are designed to make the password difficult to guess. Users are required to select a password in order to obtain access to any electronic information both at the server level and at the workstation level. When passwords are reset, the user will be automatically prompted to manually change that assigned password.

The following password best practices and restrictions are adhered to, as may be modified by the Security Officer from to time to time with reasonable alternative standards of a &quot;Strong&quot; nature:

Content Requirements - Passwords must be a minimum of eight characters, and must include at least one non-alphabetic character such as a numeral (0-9) or punctuation characters and should contain at least one upper case alphabetic character. Passwords such as fishnets or violets must not be used, since they are found in the dictionary; passwords like net4fish or v!0lets (using a ! for an &quot;i&quot; or a 0 for an &quot;o&quot;) would be acceptable. Users should not use numerals in either the first or last position with a common dictionary word, since some passwords &quot;cracking&quot; programs search for such words – _fishnet4_ is not a good password. Passwords must not contain user&#39;s name or be equal to the user ID.

Change Frequency – Compromised passwords must be changed immediately.

Restrictions on Sharing Passwords – Passwords shall not be shared, written down on paper, or stored within a file or database on a workstation and must be kept confidential.

Restrictions on Recording Passwords – Passwords are masked or suppressed on all online screens, and are never printed or included in reports or logs. Passwords are stored in an encrypted format.

Security Controls - The Security Officer shall employ the following minimum security controls with regard to password construction:

- Initial passwords issued by a security administrator are only valid for the user&#39;s first log in session and at that time, the user must be forced to choose another password.
- Passwords issued by administrators must follow the password guidelines within this standard. Temporary passwords should be unique and not guessable. It is not acceptable to create all new accounts with a default password of _mickey_ or _1234_5, for example. The initial password must follow the construction requirements noted below:
- The Security Officer&#39;s procedures must dictate that all users choose passwords that cannot be easily guessed. This means that passwords must not be a word found in the dictionary, a proper name, a place name, or a slang expression or word or items that may be easily associated with an individual. For example, a spouse&#39;s name, a home address or a pet&#39;s name must not be used. Likewise, names of RhythmScience employees, fictional characters, movie titles, attraction names, etc. must not be used.
- Passwords that utilize a basic sequence of characters that is then partially changed based on the date or some other predictable factor must not be used. For example, users must not employ passwords like &quot;Jan2000&quot; in January, &quot;Feb2000&quot; in February, etc.

Password Usage **–** The Security Officer shall implement the following minimum password usage requirements:

- All passwords shall be distributed separately from the User ID. If sent via &quot;regular&quot; mail, mailings shall have no markings indicating the nature of the enclosure. Passwords must also be concealed inside an opaque tamper-resistant envelope. If sent via e-mail, the user ID and password should be sent separately. Additionally, the subject line should not contain any indication that the message contains a password, e.g. do not send a message with a subject line of &quot;New Password&quot;.
- Password change facilities must force re-authentication prior to establishment of new password. Such a facility shall require users to enter their old password and enter the new password twice for verification.
- User&#39;s identity shall be adequately verified in the event that a user calls to have their password reset. The individual responsible for resetting the password must be able to validate that a user on the phone is, in fact, who he/she says he/she is. The questions to be asked should be formalized and provided to all Information Security Organization personnel. The reset password should be a one-time password. The individual resetting the password must also validate that the user requesting the reset is still an authorized user (see S-13.600.03).
- All vendor-supplied default passwords must be changed prior to being used on the RhythmScience network or used for RhythmScience business.
- Passwords should never be stored un-protected on PCs and automated logon routines should not include a user&#39;s password. Exceptions shall be authorized for data center for automation tools (e.g., Maestro) that require the password to execute recurring tasks, such as FTP. Access to the information stored in such applications, however, must be protected and controlled. Logs from such automation tools must also restrict and protect access to passwords.
- Consecutive unsuccessful attempts to enter a password should be limited to 3, after which the involved User ID must be temporarily disabled for no less than ten (10) minutes. If dial-up or other external network connections are involved, the connection used for the unsuccessful access attempts must be terminated. _This is a minimum standard. The Security Officer is free to institute more stringent restrictions, such as requiring accounts to be disabled until reset by an administrator, at their discretion._
- The previous 6 passwords should not be allowed to be reused. Privileged accounts such as systems administrator and database administrator accounts shall not use their passwords for the next 6 password changes. The lists of expired passwords must be adequately protected so that they may not be viewed, but are available to the system for checking against proposed new passwords.
- Passwords should be stored using one-way encryption

Passwords should never be shared or revealed to anyone other than the authorized user. To do so exposes the authorized user to responsibility for actions that the other party takes with the password. If users need to share computer resident data, they should use electronic mail, public directories on local area network servers, and other mechanisms.


## PHI Access ControlS

As a supplement to the login ID and password requirements addressed in Sections 3.1 and 3.2, RhythmScience&#39;s PHI access control system includes the following additional security features:

- Encrypted Disk and 2FA. RhythmScience utilizes an encrypted disk and 2FA for all AWS access points.
- 16-Character Password. Logging into Authorized Computers requires a 16-character password to access the approved corporate network. All Approved Tools that can access PHI are subject to the 16-character password policy.
- Remote Device Administration. Authorized Computers can be remotely locked and wiped.
- Account Lockout Threshold - After three (3) unsuccessful attempts to enter a password, the involved login ID will be temporarily disabled for thirty (30) minutes after which the account will be automatically unlocked.


## USER LOGIN Entitlement Reviews

If an RhythmScience Employee or Associate changes positions at RhythmScience, such individual&#39;s new supervisor shall promptly notify the Security Officer of the change of roles, both in terms of the roles or access that need to be added and the roles or access that need to be removed so such individual has access to the minimum necessary data to effectively perform their new job functions. The effective date of the position change should also be recorded so that the Privacy Officer can ensure that such individual will have appropriate roles, access, and applications for their new job responsibilities. For a limited training period, it may be necessary for such individual who is changing positions to maintain their previous access as well as adding the roles and access necessary for their new job responsibilities.

No less than annually, the Security Officer shall facilitate entitlement reviews to ensure that all RhythmScience Employees and Associates have the appropriate roles, access, and software necessary to perform their job functions effectively while being limited to the minimum necessary data to facilitate HIPAA compliance and protect PHI.


## Termination of User Login Account

Upon termination of a workforce member, whether voluntary or involuntary, such individual&#39;s manager shall promptly notify the Security Officer or Privacy Officer. If such individual&#39;s termination is voluntary and such individual provides notice, his/her manager shall promptly notify the Security Officer or Privacy Officer of such individual&#39;s last scheduled work day so that their access can be timely removed. The individual&#39;s manager shall be responsible for ensuring that any building access devices, as well as RhythmScience equipment and property is returned to RhythmScience prior to the workforce member leaving RhythmScience on their final day of employment.


## Wifi Security Policy

RhythmScience utilizes WPA encryption and each workforce member is responsible for his or her own security on the network. Best WIFI security practices are covered in the Security Training.


## Device Policy

Any personal or company device that can access company-related software must be password protected. The Security Officer shall establish HIPAA compliant guidelines for the appropriate uses and settings for personal cell phones utilized for work-related functions (e.g. adoption of a strong passcode). These guidelines shall be addressed as part of the Security Training Program.


## Supported Browser Policy

It is RhythmScience&#39;s policy to only use web browser versions officially supported by their developer (e.g., Microsoft, Google). Further, RhythmScience products will only allow use by supported browsers so that appropriate safeguards are in place to ensure confidentiality and security of sensitive information.


## Data Classification Policy

**Statement of Policy**

This policy is to provide the structure for classifying information at RhythmScience. These classifications are to provide the baseline for securing the information and ensuring proper handling. As used in this document, &quot;information&quot; includes both written and digital forms. It is the responsibility of all RhythmScience personnel to protect the information entrusted to us. When deciding how to correctly handle a particular piece of information, the workforce member should refer to its classification and, if in doubt, err on the side of using the most protective safeguards available.

##### Classification Types

RhythmScience considers information in four different categories. Each category has a different level of confidentiality and security to match the type of information. If an item would fall under multiple types, the most restrictive will apply. The types are listed below starting with the least restricted. All documents should be marked with their corresponding classification. This label will depend on the nature of the document and may be included in the footer, header, watermark, physical label, or in another way that clearly notes the classification of the document.

Note that the examples are given under each type are for illustrative purposes and are not meant to be exhaustive.

_ **Public** _

This type covers information that can be readily shared with third parties. Such information can be made available upon request or made available on-demand such as being posted on the RhythmScience website. This information should be general and not go into any specifics regarding sensitive matters like internal security practices.

Examples of this type include marketing materials such as flyers and whitepapers.

_ **Internal** _

Information that concerns the general business practices of RhythmScience and is not intended for public consumption. Risk to RhythmScience is low and access to this information is available to all workforce members. However, this information should only be shared with third parties where a confidentiality agreement is in place.

Examples of this type include RhythmScience policies that provide an overview of RhythmScience business practices.

_ **Confidential** _

Information falling under this type should be shared sparingly and properly secured when stored. Confidential information is information that is not meant for public consumption and its unauthorized release could negatively affect RhythmScience, its customers, or its users. Physical forms should be shredded when no longer needed and otherwise stored in a locked container. Personnel should only share Confidential Information with confidentiality agreement in place with the recipient and lesser classified information is not sufficient to fulfill the request.

Examples include detailed operating procedures of RhythmScience&#39;s business practices, pricing information, and contracting terms.

_ **Restricted** _

This type covers the most regulated data held by RhythmScience. Much of this information falls under some regulation that requires a certain standard of care with handling and storage. This information should never be shared with third parties unless absolutely necessary. For example, a contractual obligation is in place, part of an audit, or there is a legal or government action. Such information should never be shared to an unrelated party absent permission. Improper disclosure of this information would cause immediate financial and reputational harm to RhythmScience. Any workforce members who discloses restricted information could be subject to criminal charges, significant fines, litigation, and employment termination.

This type also covers highly sensitive business information of RhythmScience. Although not regulated, this information is so sensitive that it should not be shared outside of RhythmScience without necessity such as for a third party audit. All personnel should take extra care when handling information falling under this type to ensure RhythmScience maintains its rigorous standards of compliance, trust of its users, and its proprietary rights.

Examples include regulated data like PHI, source code, internal financials, and trade secrets.


## Vendor Management Policy

**Statement of Policy**

RhythmScience follows rigorous standards to ensure it is properly handling the PHI and other sensitive data entrusted to it responsibility and securely. RhythmScience is obligated to hold its HIPAA Subcontractors to the same standards and has created a process for reviewing Subcontractors and assigning a level of risk to each Subcontractor. As used within this policy &quot;business owner&quot; refers to the individual on RhythmScience&#39;s staff who is the point of contact and manager of the Subcontractor(s).


## Subcontractor Risk Assignment

Subcontractors are assigned a level of risk based on the project the Subcontractor is to work on, Subcontractor&#39;s level of access, nature of information the Subcontractor will have access to, whether the Subcontractor&#39;s work will touch RhythmScience&#39;s IT infrastructure, the history of the Subcontractor with RhythmScience, and other relevant considerations. For any Subcontractor where internal or higher classified information may be shared as part of the vetting process, an NDA must be in place protecting RhythmScience&#39;s interests. The business owner speaking with the Subcontractor is responsible for ensuring that this NDA is in place.

Subcontractors shall be categorized based on their risk level. This level may change during the term of their relationship with RhythmScience. Note that these risk levels do not necessarily reflect deficiencies with the Subcontractor but may simply recognize the nature of their services or project.

**\*Risk Levels**

- High - Subcontractor does not meet the standards of RhythmScience on compliance, security, business stability, or other reasons or the project is beyond the normal bounds of our risk tolerance. Subcontractor does not have sign off from the Privacy Officer and is not recommended to be brought on or for a standing relationship to persist. The Privacy Officer may provide the Subcontractor with steps to remediate their current practices in order to secure sign off.

- Medium - The nature of the Subcontractor&#39;s services or the project concerns PHI or sensitive information or otherwise concerns a critical aspect of RhythmScience&#39;s product or business but the Subcontractor&#39;s security, compliance, or other relevant policies are within a tolerable level given the nature of services or project.

- Low - Subcontractor&#39;s services or project do not involve the handling of PHI or sensitive information and their services or project do not otherwise pertain to a critical aspect of RhythmScience&#39;s product or business.

\*Note that for all Subcontractors that will handle PHI on behalf of RhythmScience or RhythmScience&#39;s customers, a BAA must be in place between RhythmScience and the Subcontractor prior to the Subcontractor handling any PHI on RhythmScience&#39;s behalf.

## Subcontractor Oversight and Monitoring

Subcontractors should be periodically assessed during the terms of their contracts with RhythmScience at a frequency based on their risk level or recommendation of the Privacy Officer. These assessments should include, but is not limited to, the review of the latest audit reports, certifications, current versions of policies, or the completion of a security questionnaire to reveal any changes since the last assessment. Other Subcontractors should be assessed at the time of contract renewal or at the time of a material change in services provided or contract terms. Low risk Subcontractors carry no requirement of ongoing assessment per this policy but may be assessed based on the discretion of the Privacy Officer.

Subcontractors may be given a new risk designation if their scope of service or project changes during the relationship. That change may necessitate a new review using the process above.

The business owner is responsible for communicating RhythmScience&#39;s Subcontractor requirements to their particular Subcontractors. Additionally, the business owner is responsible for ensuring RhythmScience has the most up to date contact information for the Subcontractor&#39;s compliance and security points of contact, as applicable. The business owner is also responsible for notifying the appropriate RhythmScience teams including the Privacy Officer when a Subcontractor&#39;s contract expires or is terminated.


## Software Updates

It is RhythmScience&#39;s policy to ensure that all Authorized Computers are up to date for all software installations, including anti-virus, malware, and spyware. The Security Officer is responsible for monitoring and enforcing such policy.

Remote Deployment Configuration– Through an automated procedure, updates and security patches may be pushed out to the individual workstations and servers on an as needed basis.


## Encryption

RhythmScience maintains a policy that all Authorized Computers shall have encrypted drives systems. In addition, all RhythmScience Platform components utilize SSL encryption, including connections with AWS. All PHI is encrypted at rest using industry standard data techniques (e.g., raw files are encrypted on S3 and user fields are separately encrypted.)

When encrypted data is transferred to/from a customer or Subcontractor, RhythmScience shall devise a mutually agreeable procedure with such Customer or Third Party for secure key management. In the case of a conflict, RhythmScience shall establish HIPAA compliant criteria in conjunction with the Customer or Third Party.

## Building Security

It is the policy of RhythmScience to provide building and workspace access to the Office Location in a secure manner. However, RhythmScience strives to continuously upgrade and expand its security and to enhance protection of its assets and PHI that has been entrusted to it. The following list identifies measures that are in effect at the Office Location:

- The building entrance is locked 24/7 through a key fob system.
- The Office Location is locked at all times with access only granted to individuals that work at RhythmScience.
- All paper records containing PHI are locked in a file cabinet at night or when the workforce member leaves their work area.
- Fire Protection: Uses of local building codes are observed. Manufacturer&#39;s recommendations on the fire protection of individual hardware are followed.


## Telecommuting

RhythmScience maintains a policy that telecommuting is permissible for all RhythmScience Employees and Associates. The same technical security protocols apply whether working remotely or at the Office Location. All relevant provisions of this Manual must be followed by telecommuters.

 
## General Requirements

- **Need to Know:** Telecommuting workers will have the access based on the same &#39;need to know&#39; standard as applicable in the Office Location.
- **Password Use:** The use of a strong OS password is required for telecommuting computers, and should be changed immediately if compromised. Do not share your password or write it down where a family member or visitor can see it.
- **Training:** Personnel who telecommute must complete the same annual Security Training as all other RhythmScience Employees and Associates, although such training may be completed remotely.

 
## Security Responsibilties

Authorized Workforce Members approved for telecommuting are responsible for ensuring that all work is conducted in a secure office environment isolated from visitors and family.

Non-RhythmScience Networks: Extreme care must be taken when connecting Authorized Computers to a network outside of the Office Location. Although RhythmScience actively monitors its security status and maintains organization-wide protection policies to appropriately protect data, RhythmScience has no ability to monitor or control security on outside networks.

Data Entry When in an unsecure Area or Public Location:Do not perform work tasks that require the use of PHI when you are in an unsecure area or public location, e.g., airports, airplanes, hotel lobbies.


## Use of Transportable Media

Transportable media included within the scope of this policy includes, but is not limited to, external hard drives, SD cards, DVDs, CD-ROMs, and USB key devices.

The purpose of this policy is to guide RhythmScience Employees and Associates in the proper use of transportable media when a legitimate business requirement exists to transfer data to and from RhythmScience networks. Workstations or servers that are used by Authorized Workforce Members may contain PHI or other sensitive information. Therefore, procedures must be carefully followed when copying data to or from transportable media to protect sensitive RhythmScience data. Since transportable media, by their very design, are easily lost, care and protection of these devices must be addressed. Since there is a reasonable possibility that transportable media will be provided to an RhythmScience Employee or Associate by an external source for the exchange of information, it is necessary that all workforce members have guidance in the appropriate use of media from other companies.

The use of transportable media in various formats is common within RhythmScience. All users must be aware that PHI could potentially be lost or compromised when moved outside of Authorized Computers. Transportable media received from an external source could potentially pose a threat to Authorized Computers. Rules governing the use of transportable media include the following:

- No PHI should ever be stored on transportable media unless the data is maintained in an encrypted format.
- All USB keys, portable hard drives, SD cards, etc. used to store PHI must be encrypted by the Privacy Officer or appropriate personnel.
- Authorized Workforce Members must never connect transportable media containing PHI to a workstation or computer that is not an RhythmScience Authorized Computer.
- Non-Authorized Computers may not have the same security protection standards required by RhythmScience, and accordingly computer viruses could potentially be transferred from the non-RhythmScience device to the media and then back to the RhythmScience workstation.
- It is permissible to connect transportable media from other businesses or individuals to Authorized Computers or servers as long as the source of the media is approved by the Privacy Officer or the appropriate personnel.
- Before initial use and before any PHI may be transferred to transportable media, the media must be sent to the Privacy Officer or appropriate personnel to ensure appropriate and approved encryption is used. Copy PHI only to the encrypted space on the media. Non-sensitive data may be transferred to the non-encrypted space on the media.
- Report all loss of transportable media to your supervisor. It is important that the Privacy Officer is notified immediately, either by the RhythmScience Employee or Associate or by their supervisor.
- When a workforce member leaves RhythmScience, all transportable media in their possession must be returned to the Privacy Officer or appropriate personnel for data erasure that conforms to US Department of Defense standards for data elimination.


## Data Retention Policies

  
## General Requirements

Our Data Retention Policies provide the general practices of RhythmScience regarding the retention of data. For data originating from customers or otherwise owned by customers, RhythmScience follows the language of customer agreements or the default standards as detailed below.

##### Retention Periods

_Records_

For the purpose of this policy, &quot;records&quot; means any information necessary for or explicitly required by government bodies to prove compliance. Specific government bodies or laws are listed below. For other applicable laws or regulations not contemplated during this version of this policy, RhythmScience will follow the requirements of that law or regulation.

_HIPAA_ - records will be kept for at least six years.

_CMS_ - records will be kept for at least ten years.

_Regulated Data_

For normal business operations, it is generally necessary to retain regulated data beyond the life of a customer contract. RhythmScience may retain electronic data backups including PHI for legal compliance or audit purposes for up to ten years, unless otherwise specified in the contract or unless otherwise expressly prohibited by federal, state, or local law or regulation. For the avoidance of doubt, RhythmScience may de-identify Regulated Data in accordance with Section 2.8 and other applicable law and retain such de-identified data indefinitely for lawful commercial purposes. Some considerations for specific types of regulated data are addressed below.

_PHI_ - RhythmScience adheres to the terms of the applicable customer BAA when determining data retention.

_Medical Records and other requirements -_ Requirements for medical providers to keep patient medical records varies by state. Customers are responsible to ensure the contractual relationship and directions provided to RhythmScience sufficiently cover that customer&#39;s obligations under these state laws. This responsibility extends to all over laws or regulations requiring retention of information not directly applicable to RhythmScience but may be applicable to our customers.

  
## Device and Media Re-use Policy

Any device or media containing PHI is only re-used using a method that ensures the PHI could not be readily recovered or reconstructed. The methods of reuse are reassessed periodically, based on current technology, accepted practices, and availability of timely and cost-effective reuse technologies and services.

PHI Destruction Policy – All hardcopy PHI or other sensitive or confidential records that require destruction are shredded using NIST 800-88 guidelines. Do not place PHI in a trash container without first shredding. All Authorized Workforce Members working from home or other remote locations must have direct access to a shredder if they use hardcopy PHI as part of their work.

  
## Disposable Media Policy

Devices and media known to contain PHI shall comply with the standard set forth in Section 10.2 for disposal (e.g., using a method that ensures the PHI could not be readily recovered or reconstructed). In addition, it must be assumed that any External Media in the possession of an Authorized Workforce Member is likely to contain either PHI or other sensitive information. Accordingly, all External Media (should be disposed of in a method that ensures that there will be no loss of data and that the confidentiality and security of that data will not be compromised.

The following steps must be adhered to:

- RhythmScience Employees and Associates should never dispose of External Media without consulting with the Security Officer.
- When no longer needed all forms of External Media potentially containing PHI are to be sent to the Security Officer or appropriate personnel for proper disposal.
- The media will be secured until appropriate destruction methods are used based on NIST 800-88 guidelines.

  
## Authorized Computer Disposal Policy

All Authorized Computers to be disposed of will be wiped of all data, and all settings and configurations will be reset to factory defaults. No other settings, configurations, software installation or options will be made. Asset tags and any other identifying logos or markings will be removed.

  
## Data Backup Policy

Daily, a full backup of all servers containing PHI and other regulated data shall be backed up to an encrypted file stored with RhythmScience&#39;s hosting provider. RhythmScience utilizes the backup policy of its hosting provider. Backups are maintained in two regions on the same continent unless there is only one region within a continent. RhythmScience tests backups at least annually. Backup procedures have been established that encrypt sensitive data being moved to External Media. Use only that procedure – do not create one on your own. If there is no backup procedure established, or if you have External Media that is not encrypted, contact the appropriate RhythmScience personnel for assistance. Protect External Media by keeping it in your possession.


## Data Transfer Security

Scope of Policy: This policy covers data transfers requirements that all RhythmScience Employees and Associates should be familiar with, and must be read in conjunction with RhythmScience&#39;s encryption guidelines in Section 6 of this Manual.

Sending Data Outside RhythmScience:All external transfer of sensitive data must be associated with an official contract, non-discloser agreement, or appropriate BAA. Do not transfer any PHI to anyone outside RhythmScience without the written approval of the Security Officer.

External System Access:If you require access to an external system, contact your supervisor. The Security Officer or appropriate personnel will assist in establishing a secure method of access to the external system.

Non-Encrypted Email:Workforce members are prohibited from sending emails containing PHI in a non-encrypted format. If any non-encrypted PHI is accidently received by email, it is RhythmScience policy to immediately notify the sender and delete the email (including all copies).


## Change Management Procedures

**Statement of Policy**

This Policy is designed to ensure that RhythmScience is tracking changes to networks, systems, and workstations including software releases and software vulnerability patching in information systems that contain PHI. Change tracking allows RhythmScience to efficiently troubleshoot issues that arise due to an update, new implementation, reconfiguration, or other change to the system.

**Procedure**

1. The designated RhythmScience workforce member who is updating, implementing, reconfiguring, or otherwise changing the system shall carefully log all changes made to the system.

2. When changes are tracked within a system, they do not need to be logged on the change management tracking log; however, the workforce member implementing the change will ensure that the change tracking is available for review if necessary.

3. The workforce member implementing the change will ensure that all necessary data backups are performed prior to the change.

4. The workforce member implementing the change shall also be familiar with the rollback process in the event that the change causes an adverse effect within the system and needs to be removed.

Refer to RhythmScience Change Management Policy for further information.


## Audit Controls

**Statement of Policy**

This policy is designed to ensure that RhythmScience implements hardware, software, and/or procedural mechanisms that record and examine activity in information systems that contain PHI. Audit Controls are technical mechanisms that track and record computer activities. An audit trail determines if a security violation occurred by providing a chronological series of logged computer events that relate to an operating system, an application, or user activities.

RhythmScience is committed to routinely auditing RhythmScience Employee and Associate activities in order to continually assess potential risks and vulnerabilities to PHI in its possession. As such, RhythmScience will continually assess potential risks and vulnerabilities to PHI in its possession and develop, implement, and maintain appropriate administrative, physical, and technical security measures in accordance with the Security Rule.

**Procedure**

1. See policy entitled Information System Activity Review in Section 14 for the Technical Safeguards for auditing system activities.
2. The Privacy Officer or appropriate personnel shall enable event auditing, through Third Party vendor audit logging tools (i.e., AWS), on all Authorized Computers that process, transmit, and/or store PHI for purposes of generating audit logs.
3. Monitors alert operations staff when unusual activity is detected. The Privacy Officer shall designate appropriate personnel responsible for installing, maintaining, and updating such monitors.


## Information System Activity Review

**Statement of Policy**

This policy establishes the process for conducting, on a periodic basis, an operational review of system activity including, but not limited to, user accounts, system access, file access, Security Incidents, audit logs, and access reports. RhythmScience shall conduct on a regular basis an internal review of records of system activity to minimize security violations.

**Procedure**

1. See policy entitled Audit Controls in Section 13 for a description of the technical mechanisms that track and record activities on RhythmScience&#39;s information systems that contain or use PHI.
2. The Security Officer or appropriate personnel shall be responsible for conducting reviews of Authorized Computer activities. Such person(s) shall have the appropriate technical skills with respect to the operating system and applications to access and interpret audit logs and related information appropriately.
3. The Security Officer shall develop a report format to capture the review findings. Such report shall include the reviewer&#39;s name, date and time of performance, and significant findings describing events requiring additional action (e.g., additional investigation, RhythmScience Employee and Associate training and/or discipline, program adjustments, modifications to safeguards). To the extent possible, such report shall be in a checklist format.
4. Such reviews shall be conducted annually. Audits also shall be conducted if RhythmScience has reason to suspect wrongdoing. In conducting these reviews, the Privacy Officer or appropriate personnel shall examine audit logs for security-significant events including, but not limited to, the following:

1. Logins – Scan successful and unsuccessful login attempts. Identify multiple failed login attempts, account lockouts, and unauthorized access.
2. File accesses – Scan successful and unsuccessful file access attempts. Identify multiple failed access attempts, unauthorized access, and unauthorized file creation, modification, or deletion.
3. Security Incidents – Examine records from security devices or system audit logs for events that constitute system compromises, unsuccessful compromise attempts, malicious logic (e.g., viruses, worms), denial of service, or scanning/probing incidents.
4. User Accounts – Review of user accounts within all systems to ensure users that no longer have a business need for information systems no longer have such access to the information and/or system.

All significant findings shall be recorded. Appropriate personnel shall forward all completed reports, as well as recommended actions to be taken in response to findings, to the Security Officer for review. The Security Officer shall be responsible for maintaining such reports. The Security Officer shall consider such reports and recommendations in determining whether to make changes to RhythmScience&#39;s Administrative, Physical, and Technical Safeguards.


## Data Integrity

**Statement of Policy**

RhythmScience shall implement and maintain appropriate electronic mechanisms to corroborate that PHI has not been altered or destroyed in an unauthorized manner.

The purpose of this policy is to protect RhythmScience&#39;s PHI from improper alteration or destruction.

**Procedure**

To the fullest extent possible, RhythmScience shall utilize applications with built-in intelligence that automatically checks for human errors.

RhythmScience will check for possible duplication of data in its computer systems to ensure data fidelity across different computer systems.

Patches, applications, and operating system versions are kept up to date. To prevent programming or software bugs, RhythmScience will test new versions of its information systems for accuracy and functionality prior to deployment. RhythmScience will update its systems when IT vendors release fixes to address known bugs or problems.


## Emergency Operations and Contingency Plan

**Statement of Policy**

RhythmScience is committed to maintaining a formal contingency plan for responding to an emergency or other occurrence that damages systems containing PHI. RhythmScience shall continually assess potential risks and vulnerabilities to protect PHI in its possession, and develop, implement, and maintain appropriate administrative, physical, and technical security measures in accordance with the Security Rule.

**Procedure**

Data Backup Plan

  1. RhythmScience, under the direction of the Security Officer, shall implement a data backup procedure to create and maintain retrievable exact copies of PHI.

  2. On a daily basis, a full backup of all servers containing PHI shall be backed up to an encrypted file stored on AWS.

  3. The Security Officer shall monitor storage and removal of backups and ensure all applicable access controls are enforced.

  4. The Security Officer shall test backup procedures on an annual basis to ensure that exact copies of PHI can be retrieved and made available. Such testing shall be documented. To the extent such testing indicates need for improvement in backup procedures, the Security Officer shall identify and implement such improvements in a timely manner.

Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Plan

The Security Officer shall be responsible for implementing and periodically updating the Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Plan (&quot;BCDR&quot;) for the purposes of:

    1. Restoring or recovering any loss of PHI and/or systems necessary to make PHI available in a timely manner caused by hacking incident, fire, vandalism, terrorism, system failure, or other emergency; and

    2. Continuing operations during such time information systems are unavailable. Such BCDR all have a sufficient level of detail and explanation that a person unfamiliar with the system can implement the plan in case of an emergency or disaster. Copies of the plans shall be maintained at the Office Location and at the off-site locations at which backups are stored or another secure off-site location.

Disaster Procedures

In the event that RhythmScience declares a &quot;Disaster&quot; the Security Officer shall be responsible for:

    1. Review the effectiveness of this policy for responding to any Disaster or emergency experienced by RhythmScience;

    2. In the absence of any such Disaster or emergency, plan drills to test the effectiveness of the plan and evaluate the results of such drills; and

    3. Review the BCDR and make changes as appropriate.

    4. Review and update Telephone numbers and/or e-mail addresses as necessary for all appropriate persons to be contacted in the event of an emergency, including the following:

      * Security Officer, Privacy Officer, and other Key Personnel

      * Subcontractors; and

      * All current RhythmScience Employees and Associates.

**Line of Succession**

The Emergency Operations and Contingency Plan sets forth an order of succession to ensure that decision-making authority for emergency operations is uninterrupted. The Security Officer is responsible for ensuring the safety of personnel and the execution of procedures documented within this plan. The Security Officer shall designate an alternate workforce member to fulfill the emergency response role in the event the Security Officer is unable to function in that capacity during an emergency.


## Security Awareness Training Policy

**Statement of Policy**

To establish a HIPAA compliant Security Training Program for RhythmScience Employees and Associates.

All RhythmScience Employees and Associates shall receive formal Privacy and Information Security training on an annual basis, including the updates to HIPAA found in the HITECH Act. The annual training shall be provided by the Privacy Officer and/or other designated personnel, utilizing the Security Training materials referenced in this Manual, as may be updated from time to time. Certain additional trainings shall, at the discretion of the Privacy Officer, be provided exclusively to Authorized Workforce Members related to their PHI access.

**Procedure**

HIPAA Security Training Program Overview

The Privacy Officer and/or other designated personnel shall have responsibility for developing and updating the Security Training from time to time as appropriate. The Privacy Officer shall be responsible for maintaining appropriate documentation that all RhythmScience Employees and Associates have completed the Security Training. Appropriate documentation shall include the date and signature of such attendance, and receipt of a passing score (70% or higher) on a HIPAA training quiz, to be completed by each workforce member after completing the Security Training. If a workforce member does not receive a passing score on the HIPAA training quiz, they must retake the Security Training.

Newly onboarded Workforce Members have thirty (30) days to complete the Security Training from their start date at RhythmScience, provided that no team members should be granted Authorized Workforce Member status to access PHI until after they have successfully completed the Security Training.

Security Reminders and Additional Trainings for Authorized Workforce Members

The Privacy Officer is responsible for the development and delivery of periodic security reminders (in email or other form) for RhythmScience Employees and Associates in response to Security Incidents and environmental or operational changes impacting the security of PHI, e.g., PHI breaches, addition of new hardware or software, and increased threats. The Privacy Officer shall maintain appropriate documentation for all periodic security reminders.

Authorized Workforce Members shall receive additional HIPAA trainings as needed on a discretionary basis (e.g., PHI-related responsibilities for engineers with high level access to RhythmScience Platform).


## Risk Assessment and Management Process

**Statement of Policy**

To ensure RhythmScience conducts an accurate and thorough assessment of the potential risks and vulnerabilities to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of PHI held by RhythmScience.

RhythmScience shall conduct an accurate and thorough risk analysis to serve as the basis for RhythmScience&#39;s Security Rule compliance efforts. RhythmScience shall re-assess the security risks to its PHI and evaluate the effectiveness of its security measures and safeguards on an annual basis, or as necessary in light of changes to business and technological advancements.

**Procedure**

 The Security Officer shall be responsible for coordinating RhythmScience&#39;s risk analysis.

  The risk analysis shall be completed via the utilization of an internally developed HIPAA Risk Assessment Tool, in accordance with 45 CFR 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(A) and all applicable HIPAA Security Rule guidance for risk assessments (reasonably appropriate assessment given RhythmScience&#39;s business size, scope of data processing, etc.). The following categories are recommended topics for analysis through the HIPAA Risk Assessment Tool, with any reasonably appropriate modifications to be made at the discretion of the Security Officer:

      1. Update/develop information systems inventory. List the following information for all hardware (i.e., network devices, workstations, printers, scanners, mobile devices) and software (i.e., operating system, various applications, interfaces): date acquired, vendor, function, data associated with the system.

      2. Identify each licensee (_i.e.,_ authorized user) by job title and describe the manner in which authorization is granted.

For each application identified:

  Define the criticality of the application and related data as high, medium, or low. Criticality is the degree of impact on RhythmScience if the application and/or related data were unavailable for a period of time.

  Define the sensitivity of the data as high, medium, or low. Sensitivity is the nature of the data and the harm that could result from a breach of confidentiality or security incident.

  Identify the various security controls currently in place.

Identify and document threats to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (referred to as &quot;threat agents&quot;) of PHI created, received, maintained, or transmitted by RhythmScience. Consider the following:

   * Natural threats, e.g., earthquakes, storm damage.

   * Environmental threats, e.g.,fire and smoke damage, power outage, utility problems.

Human threats

  1. Accidental acts, e.g., input errors and omissions, faulty application programming or processing procedures, failure to update/upgrade software/security devices, lack of adequate financial and human resources to support necessary security controls

  2. Inappropriate activities, e.g., inappropriate conduct, abuse of privileges or rights, workplace violence, waste of corporate assets, harassment

  3. Illegal operations and intentional attacks, e.g., eavesdropping, snooping, fraud, theft, vandalism, sabotage, blackmail

  4. External attacks, e.g., malicious cracking, scanning, demon dialing, virus introduction

Vulnerabilities in RhythmScience&#39;s information systems. A vulnerability is a flaw or weakness in security policies and procedures, design, implementation, or controls that could be accidentally triggered or intentionally exploited, resulting in unauthorized access to PHI, modification of PHI, denial of service, or repudiation (_i.e.,_ the inability to identify the source and hold some person accountable for an action). To accomplish this task, conduct a self-analysis utilizing the standards and implementation specifications to identify vulnerabilities.

      1. Determine and document probability and criticality of identified risks.

      2. Assign probability level, i.e., likelihood of a Security Incident involving identified risk.

&quot;Very Likely&quot; (3) is defined as having a probable chance of occurrence.

&quot;Likely&quot; (2) is defined as having a significant chance of occurrence.

&quot;Not Likely&quot; (1) is defined as a modest or insignificant chance of occurrence.

  1. Assign criticality level.

&quot;High&quot; (3) is defined as having a catastrophic or significant impact on RhythmScience, including a significant number of PHI records, which may have been lost or compromised.

&quot;Medium&quot; (2) is defined as having a moderate impact on RhythmScience, including a moderate number of PHI records, which may have been lost or compromised.

&quot;Low&quot; (1) is defined as a minimal or insignificant impact on RhythmScience, including de minimis loss or compromise of PHI records.

  Determine risk score for each identified risk. Multiply the probability score and criticality score. Those risks with a higher risk score require more immediate attention.

    1. Identify and document appropriate security measures and safeguards to address key vulnerabilities. To accomplish this task, review the vulnerabilities you have identified in relation to the standards and implementation specifications. Focus on those vulnerabilities with high-risk scores, as well as specific security measures and safeguards required by the Security Rule.

    2. Develop and document an implementation strategy for critical security measures and safeguards.

    3. Determine timeline for implementation.

    4. Determine costs of such measures and safeguards and secure funding.

    5. Assign responsibility for implementing specific measures and safeguards to appropriate person(s).

    6. Make necessary adjustments based on implementation experiences.

    7. Document actual completion dates.

    8. Evaluate effectiveness of measures and safeguards following implementation and make appropriate adjustments.

The Security Officer shall be responsible for identifying appropriate times to conduct follow-up evaluations and coordinating such evaluations. The Security Officer shall identify appropriate persons within RhythmScience to assist with such evaluations. Such evaluations shall be conducted upon the occurrence of one or more of the following events: changes in the Security Rule regulations; new federal, state, or local laws or regulations affecting the security of PHI; changes in technology, environmental processes, or business processes that may affect HIPAA security policies or procedures; or the occurrence of a serious security incident. As appropriate, follow-up evaluations shall include the following:

Inspections, reviews, interviews, and analysis to assess adequacy of Administrative and Physical Safeguards. Such evaluations may include interviews to assess RhythmScience Employee and Associate compliance; after-hours walk-through inspections to assess physical security, password protection (i.e., not posted), and workstation sessions terminated (i.e., RhythmScience Employees logged out); review of latest security policies and procedures for correctness and completeness; and inspection and analysis of training, incident, and media logs for compliance.

Analysis to assess adequacy of technical controls within the network, operating systems and applications. RhythmScience may engage outside vendors to evaluate existing technical security measures and make recommendations for improvement.

## Breach Notification Policy

This policy exists to provide guidance for PHI Breach investigation and notification when unauthorized access, use or disclosure of PHI may have occurred. Breach investigation and notification will be carried out in compliance with the HITECH Act as well as any other applicable federal or state data breach notification laws.

In the case of a suspected or actual PHI Breach while RhythmScience is acting in the capacity as a Business Associate, RhythmScience shall formally notify all affected Covered Entity customers in accordance with all applicable BAA notification requirements. It is the responsibility of RhythmScience&#39;s customers to notify affected patients and any other affected parties, unless an alternative procedure is otherwise specified in the applicable customer BAA(s). Additional notification may be provided to affected customers, at the discretion of the Privacy Officer, for security events that do not rise to the level of a suspected or actual PHI Breach, including security events that do not trigger any formal BAA notification requirements.

1. Discovery of Suspected Breach: A suspected Breach of PHI shall be treated as &quot;discovered&quot; as of the first day on which such incident is known to RhythmScience, or, by exercising reasonable diligence, would have been known to RhythmScience (including suspected Breaches by Subcontractors). Following the discovery of a suspected Breach, RhythmScience will immediately begin an investigation, conduct a risk assessment, and based upon the results, begin the notification process for each customer affected. At that point RhythmScience will also begin the process of determining what external notifications may be required or should be made (e.g., Secretary of Department of Health &amp; Human Services (HHS), media outlets, law enforcement officials, etc.).
2. Breach Investigation: The Privacy Officer shall act as the investigator of the suspected Breach and shall be responsible for the management of the investigation, completion of a risk assessment, and coordinating with others in the organization as appropriate. The Privacy Officer shall be the key facilitator, working in tandem with affected customers, as applicable, for all notification processes to the appropriate entities (e.g., HHS, media, law enforcement officials, etc.). All documentation related to the investigation, including the risk assessment, shall be retained for a minimum of six years. A template Breach Notification Log is included in Appendix A.
3. Risk Assessment: For an acquisition, access, use or disclosure of PHI to constitute a PHI Breach, it must constitute a violation of the HIPAA Privacy Rule. A use or disclosure of PHI that is incident to an otherwise permissible use or disclosure and occurs despite reasonable safeguards and proper minimum necessary procedures would not be a violation of the Privacy Rule and would not qualify as a PHI Breach. To determine if an impermissible use or disclosure of PHI constitutes a PHI Breach and requires further notification, RhythmScience needs to perform a risk assessment to determine if there is greater than a low probability the PHI has been compromised as a result of the impermissible use or disclosure. RhythmScience will document the risk assessment as part of the investigation in an incident report form noting the outcome of the risk assessment process. RhythmScience has the burden of proof for demonstrating that all notifications are made to applicable customers and other external parties, or that the use or disclosure did not constitute a PHI Breach. Based on the outcome of the risk assessment, RhythmScience will determine the need to move forward with the notification process. The risk assessment and the supporting documentation shall be fact specific and address, as applicable:
  - Consideration of who impermissibly used or to whom the information was impermissibly disclosed;
  - The type and amount of PHI involved, including types of identifiers and the likelihood of re-identification;
  - The cause of the suspected Breach, and the entity responsible for the suspected Breach, whether, a third party Subcontractor, RhythmScience or an applicable customer;
  - Whether the PHI was actually acquired or viewed; and
  - The potential for significant risk of financial, reputational, or other harm and the extent to which the risk to the PHI has been mitigated.
4. Timeliness of Notification: Upon verification of an actual or reasonably suspected PHI Breach, notice shall be made to the affected customers, as applicable within the timeframe stipulated in the relevant BAA(s), and no later than 60 days from the date of discovery in any circumstances. It is the responsibility of RhythmScience to demonstrate that all applicable notifications were made as legally required, including RhythmScience demonstrating the necessity of delay.
5. Delay of Notification Authorized for Law Enforcement Purposes: If a law enforcement official states to RhythmScience that a notification, notice, or posting would impede a criminal investigation or cause damage to national security, RhythmScience shall:
  - If the statement is in writing and specifies the time for which a delay is required, delay such notification, notice, or posting of the time period specified by the official; or
  - If the statement is made orally, document the statement, including the identity of the official making the statement, and delay the notification, notice, or posting temporarily and no longer than 30 days from the date of the oral statement, unless a written statement as described above is submitted during that time.
6. Content of the Notice: The notice shall be written in plain language and must contain the following information:
  - A brief description of what happened, including the date of the PHI Breach and the date of the discovery of the suspected Breach, if known;
  - A description of the types of unsecured PHI that were involved in the PHI Breach (such as whether full name, Social Security number, date of birth, home address, account number, diagnosis, disability code or other types of information were involved), if known;
  - Any steps the customer should take to protect patients from potential harm resulting from the PHI Breach;
  - A brief description of what RhythmScience is doing to investigate the PHI Breach, to mitigate harm to individuals and customers, and to protect against further Breaches; and
  - Contact procedures for customers to ask questions or learn additional information.
7. Methods of Notification: Applicable parties will be notified via email or mail within the timeframe for reporting Breaches, as outlined above.
8. Maintenance of Breach Notification Log: As outlined in Appendix A, RhythmScience shall maintain a process to record or log all suspected Breaches regardless of the number of records and customers affected. The following information should be collected/logged for each suspected Breach:
  - A description of what happened, including the date of the discovery of the suspected Breach, the date of verification of a PHI Breach, and the number of patient records and customers affected, if known.
  - A description of the types of unsecured PHI that were involved in the suspected Breach (such as full name, Social Security number, date of birth, home address, account number, etc.), if known.
  - A description of the action taken with regard to notification of customers and other parties as applicable for each PHI Breach.
  - A determination of whether a PHI Breach has been verified.
  - Resolution steps taken to mitigate the PHI Breach and prevent future occurrences.

**Appendix A**

**Breach Notification Log Template**

RhythmScience shall utilize a Breach Notification Log to record all suspected Breaches of unsecured PHI regardless of the number of customers or individuals affected. A record of the complete investigation of the suspected Breach as well as the risk assessment carried out to determine notification requirements should be created. The risk assessment and the record/event report should be cross-referenced so that it would be easy to locate and provide any additional information required by the HHS Secretary.
