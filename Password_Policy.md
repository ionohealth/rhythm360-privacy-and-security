## [Passwords](

**User Account Passwords**

User account passwords are required in order for RhythmScience Employees and Associates to gain access to all Approved Tools and network access points. All passwords are restricted by a company-wide password policy to be of a &quot;Strong&quot; nature. This means that all passwords must conform to restrictions and limitations that are designed to make the password difficult to guess. Users are required to select a password in order to obtain access to any electronic information both at the server level and at the workstation level. When passwords are reset, the user will be automatically prompted to manually change that assigned password.

The following password best practices and restrictions are adhered to, as may be modified by the Security Officer from to time to time with reasonable alternative standards of a &quot;Strong&quot; nature:

Content Requirements - Passwords must be a minimum of eight characters, and must include at least one non-alphabetic character such as a numeral (0-9) or punctuation characters and should contain at least one upper case alphabetic character. Passwords such as fishnets or violets must not be used, since they are found in the dictionary; passwords like net4fish or v!0lets (using a ! for an &quot;i&quot; or a 0 for an &quot;o&quot;) would be acceptable. Users should not use numerals in either the first or last position with a common dictionary word, since some passwords &quot;cracking&quot; programs search for such words – _fishnet4_ is not a good password. Passwords must not contain user&#39;s name or be equal to the user ID.

Change Frequency – Compromised passwords must be changed immediately.

Restrictions on Sharing Passwords – Passwords shall not be shared, written down on paper, or stored within a file or database on a workstation and must be kept confidential.

Restrictions on Recording Passwords – Passwords are masked or suppressed on all online screens, and are never printed or included in reports or logs. Passwords are stored in an encrypted format.

Security Controls - The Security Officer shall employ the following minimum security controls with regard to password construction:

- Initial passwords issued by a security administrator are only valid for the user&#39;s first log in session and at that time, the user must be forced to choose another password.
- Passwords issued by administrators must follow the password guidelines within this standard. Temporary passwords should be unique and not guessable. It is not acceptable to create all new accounts with a default password of _mickey_ or _1234_5, for example. The initial password must follow the construction requirements noted below:
- The Security Officer&#39;s procedures must dictate that all users choose passwords that cannot be easily guessed. This means that passwords must not be a word found in the dictionary, a proper name, a place name, or a slang expression or word or items that may be easily associated with an individual. For example, a spouse&#39;s name, a home address or a pet&#39;s name must not be used. Likewise, names of RhythmScience employees, fictional characters, movie titles, attraction names, etc. must not be used.
- Passwords that utilize a basic sequence of characters that is then partially changed based on the date or some other predictable factor must not be used. For example, users must not employ passwords like &quot;Jan2000&quot; in January, &quot;Feb2000&quot; in February, etc.

Password Usage **–** The Security Officer shall implement the following minimum password usage requirements:

- All passwords shall be distributed separately from the User ID. If sent via &quot;regular&quot; mail, mailings shall have no markings indicating the nature of the enclosure. Passwords must also be concealed inside an opaque tamper-resistant envelope. If sent via e-mail, the user ID and password should be sent separately. Additionally, the subject line should not contain any indication that the message contains a password, e.g. do not send a message with a subject line of &quot;New Password&quot;.
- Password change facilities must force re-authentication prior to establishment of new password. Such a facility shall require users to enter their old password and enter the new password twice for verification.
- User&#39;s identity shall be adequately verified in the event that a user calls to have their password reset. The individual responsible for resetting the password must be able to validate that a user on the phone is, in fact, who he/she says he/she is. The questions to be asked should be formalized and provided to all Information Security Organization personnel. The reset password should be a one-time password. The individual resetting the password must also validate that the user requesting the reset is still an authorized user (see S-13.600.03).
- All vendor-supplied default passwords must be changed prior to being used on the RhythmScience network or used for RhythmScience business.
- Passwords should never be stored un-protected on PCs and automated logon routines should not include a user&#39;s password. Exceptions shall be authorized for data center for automation tools (e.g., Maestro) that require the password to execute recurring tasks, such as FTP. Access to the information stored in such applications, however, must be protected and controlled. Logs from such automation tools must also restrict and protect access to passwords.
- Consecutive unsuccessful attempts to enter a password should be limited to 3, after which the involved User ID must be temporarily disabled for no less than ten (10) minutes. If dial-up or other external network connections are involved, the connection used for the unsuccessful access attempts must be terminated. _This is a minimum standard. The Security Officer is free to institute more stringent restrictions, such as requiring accounts to be disabled until reset by an administrator, at their discretion._
- The previous 6 passwords should not be allowed to be reused. Privileged accounts such as systems administrator and database administrator accounts shall not use their passwords for the next 6 password changes. The lists of expired passwords must be adequately protected so that they may not be viewed, but are available to the system for checking against proposed new passwords.
- Passwords should be stored using one-way encryption

Passwords should never be shared or revealed to anyone other than the authorized user. To do so exposes the authorized user to responsibility for actions that the other party takes with the password. If users need to share computer resident data, they should use electronic mail, public directories on local area network servers, and other mechanisms.
